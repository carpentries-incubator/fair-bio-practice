## General information

This lesson provides the foundation for practical incorporation of Open Science and FAIR data principles into biological research data managment.

We [(the UoE BioRDM team)](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/RDMS/Research+Data+Management+SynthSys+%28f1sysrdm%29+Home) have identified that a gap exists in the knowledge of how to apply FAIR principles to real-life day-to-day biological research. An understanding of the principles of good data management is just as important as the practicalities. Researchers must become conversant with the Open Science ethos, the Reproducible Research movement, and the FAIR principles, to explain their new skills and to recognize or evaluate them in their peers.

The overall goals of the lesson are: 
* To teach solid basic concepts in open science, FAIR guidelines and data management.
* To teach how to be FAIR in practice.
* To teach how to organize research workflows in such a way that it is easy to make biological research open, findable and reusable.

We are developing this lesson as part of the ED-DaSH consortium, supported by the "Data driven life science skills development - equipping society for the future" UKRI-MRC grant MR/V039075/1.
