## What are Templates
Templates are documents with a pre-determined layout and style which allow for reproducibility
of new documents based on the same layout/pattern/style/guidelines. For example a useful
template are label templates that contain all necessary experimental information. Thinking back
to our arabidopsis experiment, a tube label template for an experiment could contain: date,
genotype, if short- or light-day.

> ## Benefits of Templates
> Use of such templates is incredibly convenient. If we were to print labels for tubes, using a
> template we could print an entire batch at once instead of having to do it label by label or
> hand write each individual one. Overall templates:
> 
> * save time
> * enforce best practices (e.g. naming standards, using PIDs)
> * provide guidelines for other users of the template
> * assure consistency across sample collection, experiments, and data analysis
> * allow automatisation of searching/processing/analysis
> * ensure reproducibility! (FAIR)

## Types of templates
Templates could be anything with a pre-determined layout and purpose to be used for **repeating activities**. For example templates could be:
* in an ELN for different experiment types (e.g. Benchling)
* for sample recording and registration (e.g. in Clinical Trial Management)
* for project structure
* for a readme file
* for a data management plan

> ## Exercise 1: Your template (30 min at end of day + 15 min next day discussing templates)
>
> Write your own group template for either
> * a measurement (PCR on robot etc...)
> * experiment (e.g. gene levels in response to stress)
>
> In Excel or as a Document (txt/word) or Benchling (if you fancy using it!), 
> also provide some example data.
>
> Think about:
> * what you will need as the producer
> * what you will need as the consumer
> * how you could limit the values (controlled vocabularies)
> * what PID or ontology terms you could use to annotate
>
> Drop the templates into the folder shared on the Notepad.
> Make sure to exchange emails in case Zoom dies.
