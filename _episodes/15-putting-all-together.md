For the past three days we have discussed how you can embark on a journey to be FAIR,
we also showed you tools you can use in your daily life and throughout the research data 
life cycle to make your data more: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible

Simple things like thinking about the metadata that can accompany your data, use of 
templates and preparation of your data for future sharing can help in achieving Open Research
and better FAIR practices. We now want to hear from you what you will change after this
course to be more FAIR:

> ## Exercise 1: Your journey to be FAIRproductive
>
> What are the things you are going to change in your work habits, or actions you are going to take after this course?
>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> *  For each paper I publish I will make a Zenodo deposit with all the data files
>> *  I will use GitHub for all my code instead of using folders
>> *  I will start using ELNs
>> *  Write a data management plan for my project
>> *  Reorganise my folder structure
>> *  Use templates
>> *  Start using readme files (make a readme template)
>> *  Write protocols on protocols.io
>> *  Back up my data accordingly
>> *  Think as a user of my data instead of just a creator
>> *  Start using Jupyter notebooks, or RMarkdown to describe analysis workflows
>> *  Write intelligible metadata

As you can see, anything counts. Even simple things like reorganisation of your folder
structure for a better overview or to stop using USB sticks as backup material are steps
towards FAIR. We have collated here the list of resources throughout the course for a 
better overview which will hopefully help you to guide future practices.

> ## Repositories and Ontologies
> #### Data agnostic repositories
> There are general "data agnostic" repositories, for example:
> * [Dryad](http://datadryad.org),
> * [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org),
> * [FigShare](http://figshare.com),
> * [Dataverse](http://thedata.org).
> 
> #### Or domain specific, for example:
> * [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) protein data,
> * [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) sequence data,
> * [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) metabolomics data
> * [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code.
> 
> Similar to ORCID, there are other registries that can be used to identify many
> of biological concepts and entities:
> * species e.g. [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy)
> * chemicals e.g. [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi)
> * proteins e.g. [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
> * genes e.g. [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
> * metabolic reactions, enzymes e.g [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
> 
> [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/) or
> [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)  
> are good places to start searching for a registry or a term.
> 
> #### Here some links to help you find the right ontologies for your research:
