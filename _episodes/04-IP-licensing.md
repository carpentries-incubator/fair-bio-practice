## Open Science and Intellectual property

> *This section is tailored to the EU and UK.*
>
> Intellectual property (IP) is something that you create using your
> mind - for example, a story, an invention, an artistic work
> or a symbol.
>
> The timeline of "opening" matters when one seeks legal protection
> for his IP.
>
> For example, patents are granted only for inventions that are
> **new and were not known to the public** in any form.
> Publishing in a journal or presenting in a conference
> information related to the invention completely
> **prevents the inventor from getting a patent**!
>
> In our opinion, you are more likely to benefit from new collaborations,
> industrial partnerships, consultations which are acquired by openness,
> than from patent related royalties.

> ## (Optional) Intellectual property protection
> *This section is tailored to the EU and UK.*
>
> You can use a patent to protect your (*technical*) invention.
> It gives you the right to take legal action against anyone who
> makes, uses, sells or imports it without your permission.
>
> Discoveries, mathematical methods, computer programs and
> business methods as such are not regarded as inventions.
> Surgical and therapeutic procedures,
> diagnostic methods and new plant or animal varieties are
> completely excluded from patentability.
>
> Patents are granted only for inventions that are
> **new and were not known to the public** in any form.
> Publishing in a journal or presenting in a conference
> information related to the invention completely
> **prevents the inventor from getting a patent**!
>
> In principle, software cannot be patented.
> However, it is a “no but yes” situation, and a software patent
> are being granted. It is usually, settled by the court for each case.
>
> **Software code is copyrighted**. Copyright prevents people from:
> *	copying your code
> *	distributing copies of it, whether free of charge or for sale.
>
> Data cannot be patented, and in principle, it cannot be copyrighted.
> **It is not possible to copyright facts!**
>
> However, how data are collated and presented
> (especially if it is a database),
> can have a layer of copyright protection.
> Deciding what data needs to be included in a database,
> how to organize the data, and how to relate different data elements are all creative
> decisions that may receive copyright protection.
> Again, it is often a case by case situation and may come down to who has
> better lawyers.

> ## Exercise 1: Checking common licenses (5 min + discussion)
> 1. Open CC BY license summary [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
is it clear how you can use the data under this licence and why it is popular in academia?
>
> 2. Check the MIT license wording: [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
is it clear what you can do with software code under this licence?
>
> 3. Compare the full wording of CC BY
[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)
can you guess why the MIT licence is currently one of the most popular for open source code?
> 
>> ## Solution
>>
>> 1. CC BY license states material can be reproduced, shared, in whole or in part, unless where exceptions and limitations are stated. Attributions must be made to the Licensor.
>> 2. MIT license states that Software can by used without restriction (to copy, modify, publish, distribute etc...)
>> 3. The MIT license is short, to the point and optimised for software developers as it offers flexibility.
